# Classification

Requires pandas, numpy, scipy, plotly and scikit-learn to run.                                                                             
To run Mathematical Model for Logistic Regression: python logistic.py                                                                     
To run Scikit-Learn Model for Logistic Regression: python scilog.py                                                                       

Mathematical Model takes ~ 11 minutes to execute on Windows Computer using an i7 4th gen cpu
